# BA-mock-project-e-commerce-
Project Name: flowers Ecommerce		
Prepared By: Angelo Palumbo			Date: June 30 2025

This whole first project was based on mock data 
Project Summary:
The ecommerce flower business needs help with his order tracking system, I’ve analysed the situation with the data provided by the company. . After analysing the data I have realised that many customers, since they weren’t able to track their shipment, decided to ask for a refund, providing a poor feedback, Hurting the business even more. 
I’ve found that the best way to fix this issue is to create a API system that was going to provide customers with real time updates on their shipments. 
Project Objectives
     PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
Automate order Tracking
Provide real Time delivery updates to customers
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
Analyse Shipment Partner Performance to make informed decisions 

Tools and Techniques used:
   Tools: Microsoft Excel, LucidCharts, Mockaroo(for mock database generations), Jira.
Techniques: BPMN process modelling, Pivot Tables and Data visualisation Techniques(filtered Bar charts, pie charts…), As Is/To Be programs.

Approach and Methodology:
Problem identification: Conducted stakeholder analysis to identify pain points in the current order tracking system( backed by data)
Data collection
Analysis: Build pivot tables in order to see which Delivery partners performed best
Process Improvement: analysed the current state of the process(As Is), and came up with 
solutions(To Be).
StakeHolder Management Technique: in order to understand which stakeholders need to be managed closely we need to analyse them in relation to the influence that they have on the business and their power. Naturally we came to the conclusion that customers and OFT(order fulfilment teams) are the ones that require more managing.(I used a LucidChart interactive Dashboard, you can see it in the Visual Artifacts).



Stake Holder Management:
This part is crucial to understand how to treat stakeholders during the Business Analysis, as we can see down on the diagram the two stakeholders that should be managed closely are in fact Customers and Order Fulfilment team



if we look at the Data Visualisation We can clearly see how FedEx was the top performer in all the partners used by the Ecommerce.

We can see how 4.08 PM was the best Timestamp in the whole day. We must make sure that the Website Shipping featured work properly in the afternoon timestamp.


We can see that many orders had been shipped but not yet arrived, long shipping time can create a bad Customer experience. The business must negotiate with the Delivery partners in order to make shipping faster. 

Jira Issue Breakdown:
Using the MoSCoW technique i divided the various issue into priorities in Jira


This feature above is a Must Have since it’s the backbone of the Resolution, with this alone the issue is fixed, but only with the features of the second issue down there that we can really make this a good customer experience.
